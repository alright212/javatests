Write a method that takes two integers as an argument and returns a word that shows the relationship between the two numbers:

if the numbers are equal, return: "A == B", where A and B are the values of the arguments
if the numbers are not equal, return: "A <B", where A is the value of the smaller argument and B is the value of the larger argument.
The returned word has one space before and after the character (either "<" or "=="). There are no more spaces in the word (the remaining symbols are all numbers).

public class Exercise {
    public static String smallerThan(int a, int b) {
        if (a == b) {
            return a + " == " + b;
        } else if (a > b) {
            return b + " < " + a;
        } else {
            return a + " < " + b;
        }
    }
}
